# Rust Compiler Project

The goal of this project is to create a translator for a subset of the Rust language, which we will call Mini Rust. The objective will be to write a lexical and syntax analyzer using Antlr, then a semantic analyzer, and to translate the Mini Rust code into C language. 

This project is a group project done in Telecom Nancy, french engineering school. 

The project is aviable on [GitHub](https://github.com/lorisalx/rust-compiler).
