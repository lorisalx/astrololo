## AstroLolo

The project is available on [GitHub](https://github.com/lorisalx/astrololo).

### Technologies

* [AstroJS](https://astro.build)
* TypeScript
* i18next

### Project

Thanks to Astro, I was able to create a static website, with a fast generation, and a good user experience. I used [this template](https://astro.build/themes/details/portfolio/) as a starting point. I also used TypeScript, which allowed me to have cleaner and more maintainable code. Finally, I was able to use i18next for internationalization, which allowed me to create a French version of the site.

### Lighthouse

Lighthouse is a Google tool that allows you to test the quality of a website. It allows you to test performance, accessibility, best practices and user experience. Here are the results obtained for the site:

As you can see, the site gets a perfect score in all areas!
